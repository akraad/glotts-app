### 5) Support and communications

## How we use information

We use information to:

- Personalize learning (recommendations, difficulty adjustments, language settings)
- Improve the Service (analytics, performance monitoring, debugging)
- Maintain security (fraud prevention, abuse detection, access control)
- Process purchases and manage subscriptions (entitlements, refunds support)
- Communicate with you (support responses, service updates)

## Legal bases (where applicable)

Where required by law, we process personal data under one or more legal bases, such as:

- Performance of a contract (providing the Service you request)
- Legitimate interests (improving and securing the Service)
- Consent (where you have a choice, e.g., optional analytics—if implemented)
- Compliance with legal obligations

## How we share information

We may share information:

- **With service providers** who help us run the Service (hosting, analytics, crash reporting, customer support). They are allowed to use data only to provide services to us.
- **For legal reasons** if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.
- **With your consent** when you choose to share.

We do not sell your personal information.

## Data retention

We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes described above, including:

- While your account is active
- As needed to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements

When you request deletion, we delete or anonymize your data unless we must retain some information for legal, tax, fraud-prevention, or security reasons.

## Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. No system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children’s privacy

The Service is not intended for children under the minimum age required by local law to use online services without parental consent. If you believe a child has provided us personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

## International transfers

Your data may be processed in countries other than where you live. We take steps to protect data in accordance with applicable laws (for example, through contractual protections where required).

## Your choices and rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:

- Accessing the personal data we hold about you
- Correcting inaccurate information
- Deleting your account and associated data
- Objecting to or restricting certain processing
- Portability of your data (where applicable)
- Withdrawing consent (where consent is the legal basis)

To exercise your rights, contact us at the email above.

## Third-party links and services

The Service may link to third-party websites or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, if changes are significant, may provide additional notice in the app or by other means.

# Glotts Account Deletion

Last updated: 2026-02-14

This page explains how you can delete your Glotts account and what happens to your data when you do.

## How to delete your account

You can request account deletion in one of these ways:

### Option A: In the app (if available)

1. Open Glotts
2. Go to **Profile / Settings**
3. Choose **Delete account**
4. Follow the on-screen confirmation steps

### Option B: By email

If you cannot access the app, email us from the email address associated with your Glotts account:

- **Email:** raadix.dec@gmail.com
- **Subject:** Account deletion request

Please include:

- The email address used for your Glotts account
- (Optional) Your user ID if visible in the app
- A short confirmation such as: “I confirm I want to permanently delete my Glotts account.”

## What we delete

When your deletion request is processed, we delete or anonymize (where appropriate):

- Your account profile (e.g., email, display name, auth identifiers)
- Your learning history and progress (reviews, lesson completion, quiz history)
- Any saved preferences associated with your account

## What we may retain (limited cases)

We may retain certain information when required for:

- Legal or regulatory compliance
- Fraud prevention and security
- Accounting and tax records related to purchases (if applicable)
- Resolving disputes and enforcing agreements

If retained, this information is stored securely and access is limited.

## What happens to purchases/subscriptions

Subscriptions and purchases are managed by the app store/payment provider. Deleting your Glotts account does not automatically cancel an active subscription. Please cancel subscriptions via the store used to purchase them (Google Play, etc.).

## Timeline

- We aim to process deletion requests within **30 days**.
- In some cases (e.g., complex verification or legal requirements), it may take longer; we will respond if we need more information.

## Identity verification

To protect your account, we may ask you to verify ownership before deletion (for example, by responding from the account email or confirming details visible only to you).
